# Simple ECS
##### A simple entity component system with entities, components, and queries.

Core files:
- Ecs.cs
- ComponentManager.cs
- IComponent.cs

Example files:
- Program.cs
- PositionComponent.cs
- RotationComponent.cs

This ECS is designed for simplicity rather than robustness or performance. Support for systems is limited to querying. How systems are run must implemented by the user.
